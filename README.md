With `SoakpClient`, you can effortlessly integrate the OpenAI API into your user interfaces, providing engaging and interactive experiences for your users. By leveraging a local [SOAKP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lehcode/soakp) at `https://localhost:<3033>/openai/<completions>`, this library ensures secure communication with the OpenAI API, all while complying with browser security restrictions and OpenAI security guidelines. The SOAKP client library is an advanced wrapper of the original `openai` library.

## Key Features
