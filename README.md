# Secure OpenAI Key Proxy (SOAKP) Client

SOAKP-client is a browser library to leverage OpenAI API and for secure integration of OpenAI API _directly into UI applications_, thus overcoming limitations of using the original `openai` library in a browser environment.

With SOAKP-client, you can effortlessly integrate the OpenAI API into your user interfaces, providing engaging and interactive experiences for your users. By leveraging a local [SOAKP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lehcode/soakp) at `https://<localhost>:<3033>/openai/<completions>`, this library ensures secure communication with the OpenAI API, all while complying with browser security restrictions and OpenAI security guidelines. The SOAKP client library is an advanced wrapper of the original `openai` library.
